# Reverse-engineering research notes

This document is the long-form record of the investigation. It is deliberately
more conversational than a disassembly listing because the useful part of this
project is the chain of evidence: what the binary says, what the emulator did,
and where the two still disagree.

## Starting point

The primary APK is an old Graal Online Classic 1.8 build. Its package is
`com.quattroplay.GraalClassic`, version code 6158, version name 1.8, with
launcher activity `com.quattroplay.GraalClassic.QPlayActivity`. The APK
contains ARM64 and x86_64 native libraries. The ARM64 `libqplay.so` was loaded
into IDA because that is the architecture with the most useful symbol
information. The available emulator is x86_64, so the x86_64 library was used
for runtime checks against the same application family.

The original files are kept in the private working directory and are not
committed here. The public archive contains hashes, symbol exports, scripts,
and notes, but not the APK or a copied game data set.

The two helper projects were checked out
locally at these commits:

* `GScript.Go-HexaParser` at `ad9bd3657feece825b5f5a888f5db34ffe37afb9`.
* `Moreno.kahn` at `5e3a05fc8fbcf3c3f72b3c263238b2ed275fc66d`.

The custom `con` tool produced the same ZIP payload as the independent
decoder. That cross-check separated a package parsing mistake from a client
compatibility problem.

## Symbol pass

The first pass was intentionally mechanical. It extracted the surviving ELF
symbols, demangled the C++ names, classified implementation functions, thunks,
and data, and applied aliases to the ARM64 IDA database. The final summary is:

* translated symbols: 8,601;
* renamed functions: 4,714;
* PLT thunks: 3,183;
* jump thunks: 199;
* data symbols: 505;
* rename failures: 0.

The complete machine-readable result is in `symbols/`. Keeping the original
mangled name beside the demangled name preserves a useful lookup key. A thunk
is named separately from its target so cross-references do not become
ambiguous.

The translated symbols changed the pace of the rest of the investigation.
Instead of guessing from strings, the connector and login flow could be
followed by name. Important ARM64 addresses include:

* `TServerList_login` at `0x204420`;
* `TServerList_enterNextConnectorMode_int` at `0x203df4`;
* `TClient_connectToGameServer` at `0x1e7058`;
* `TGraalConnection_connectToServer` at `0x1feb98`;
* `TSocketConnection_connectSocket` at `0x206bd8`;
* `TSocketConnection_checkConnecting` at `0x206a48`;
* `TSocketConnection_enableSSLOnSocket` at `0x206450`;
* `THTTPRequest_sendRequest` at `0x1ffde8`;
* `THTTPRequest_saveDownloadedData` at `0x200010`;
* `THTTPRequest_runScript` at `0x2025a0`;
* `TClient_parse` at `0x1e7cd0`;
* `TServerLevel_LoadEncrypted_void` at `0x1aa198`.

## Connector and TLS

The startup path creates an HTTP request for one of three connector modes.
Modes 1 and 2 use HTTPS. Mode 3 uses an older HTTP fallback. The client sends
the version, build date, platform, and a DES plus Base64 parameter list. It
also sends a `p=` query generated for the request rather than a constant URL
parameter.

The HTTPS path is native CyaSSL. The certificate is not supplied by Android's
Java trust store. `TSocketConnection_setVerifyGraalWebCert` decrypts an
embedded certificate and supplies it to the CyaSSL context. The certificate
expired on 2023-07-29, and the verifier's date routine consults the current
clock. That is a real compatibility failure for a current device.

An expired certificate does not explain every observed failure. A diagnostic
build that forced the parser through plain HTTP still did not advance until
the response format was made compatible. Certificate repair is necessary for
the old HTTPS path, but it is not sufficient evidence of a working client.

## Connector package

The response named `con.png` is a binary package. Its first four bytes are a
big-endian signature length, followed by a 256-byte signature, a second
big-endian payload length, and the encrypted ZIP. The archived body is 16,446
bytes and decrypts to a valid ZIP containing `.rk`, `.t`, and
`NPCS/StartScript_Connector`.

The body does not validate against the public key recovered from this APK.
The package is therefore a stale or mismatched artifact for a strict client.
The local test has a narrowly scoped RSA branch bypass so the script compiler
can be studied. That bypass is not a safe release repair.

The response-header finding needed a correction after a second IDA pass. The
function `THTTPRequest_preParseData_void` at `0x201d68` lowercases each header
line with `TString::lower` before matching `server:`, `content-length:`,
`content-type:`, and the other fields. Header-name capitalization is therefore
not a client compatibility requirement.

The same local diagnostic APK and connector body were then tested with three
response variants. Lowercase names plus `Connection: keep-alive`, title-case
names plus `Connection: keep-alive`, and lowercase names plus
`Connection: close` all reached the game responder, completed both game
connections, and requested the GMAP and three level files. The parser does
recognize the exact lowercased value `connection: keep-alive` as a reuse hint,
but a close response with a valid `Content-Length` still completed this
bounded replay. A fourth replay without `Content-Length` also completed when
the responder half-closed its write side, giving the stream parser an EOF
boundary. The old note that lowercase names were required is withdrawn.

The replay tool keeps lowercase names and `keep-alive` as conservative legacy
defaults, and exposes `--header-case` and `--connection-value` for controlled
tests. It also exposes `--omit-content-length` for the EOF case. The earlier
capitalized-header failure was confounded by another response or timing
difference that has not been reproduced, so it should not be treated as
evidence of a header-case rule.

## Script to native handler boundary

The decoded connector script installs inbound handler pairs. The pair for
server login is `(54, 10)`. The first reading of the setter treated the VM
array as reversed and suggested swapping the two values. That interpretation
was disproved by the live IDA table and by the successful no-swap replay.

The original ARM64 instructions at `0x1ea7ac` and `0x1ea7b4` are the correct
lookup and store for this library revision:

```text
0x1ea7ac: 00 d8 62 f8
0x1ea7b4: 40 d8 21 f8
```

The x86_64 build likewise retains the original bytes around `0x202ea0`,
including `83 f9 5e 7f 96 48 63 c9`. The `xchg ecx,edx` patch at `0x202ea5`
was a negative control. It changed the table enough to break the normal
protocol sequence, so it is no longer included in the compatibility patcher.

This conclusion is independent of the expired connector certificate and the
stale package signature. Keeping those diagnostics separate makes it clear
which changes are needed to study the client and which bytes are already
correct.

## NewGraal key exchange

The local game responder initially used a guessed frame sequence. Static
tracing of `setProtocol_NewGraal`, `setEncryptionIn`, and `setEncryptionOut`,
followed by capture decoding, established the actual behavior:

* `GNP1905C` identifies the protocol;
* the first client exchange is an outer type `0xfd` frame;
* the server returns type `0xfc` with encrypted key setup;
* the client then emits an encrypted login envelope;
* the first ordinary server sequence is zero after key setup;
* RC4 state is continuous across the direction, not recreated per frame.

The test responder uses a deterministic outgoing key only in the diagnostic
APK. That lets the local server decode the client's login envelope without
implementing the server's private RSA path. The key is not a real account
credential and is not included in this repository.

## Server warp and packet mapping

The connector script selected a login host and port. To keep the test local,
the responder sends packet 178 with a comma-separated destination that points
to `127.0.0.1:14900`. The client prints `Serverwarp...`, closes the first game
socket, reconnects, and replays its login sequence. Packet 48 is a trigger
action in this client table, not the server-warp instruction.

The final second connection sends packet 9 with a minimal own-player property,
packet 190 with an empty body, and packet 49 with the GMAP transition. The
packet 9 body for the test name `test` is `20 24 74 65 73 74`. Packet 190
reaches `sub_1EB4C0`, which hides the connecting window and invokes the
server-list connection callback. This corrected the earlier assumption that
packet 182 was the completion event. Static analysis maps packet 182 to the
process or window-list path at handler index 15.

The packet 49 body contains five encoded coordinate bytes followed by the
map name. The local body is:

```text
20 20 52 20 20 63 6c 61 73 73 69 63 69 70 68 6f 6e 65 2e 67 6d 61 70
```

The map name is deliberately `classiciphone.gmap`. An earlier experiment sent
a bare `.nw` name through packet 7, a client-specific level-selection path,
which did not enter the same GMAP transition. The final replay uses packet 49
and does not rely on packet 7.

## Level loader investigation

The client requested these levels in the corrected local trace:

* `overworld_west_ocean_09.nw`;
* `overworld_west_ocean_02.nw`;
* `overworld_west_ocean_10.nw`.

The responder returned files named with the port suffix, such as
`overworld_west_ocean_09.nw-14900.code`. The files were made by taking a
known-good cached `black.nw-14896.code` container, decrypting it, changing the
server identity, signature, and level-name field, then re-encrypting it under
the new level filename.

The container helper passed a round trip against the original file and the
client's external cache contains the exact 316-byte files that were sent. The
final replay then loaded all three containers and rendered the tile field and
HUD. This closes the earlier loader-versus-dispatch question for the local
path. The remaining uncertainty is whether a live server provides the same
identity, signature, and resource sequence.

## Cache path correction

There was a misleading intermediate result when files were placed in
`/data/user/0/com.quattroplay.GraalClassic/files`. The Java application data
directory exists and is readable through `run-as`, but the native downloader
reports and uses the external path under
`/storage/emulated/0/Android/data/com.quattroplay.GraalClassiC/files` for game
assets. The external path contains the map, image, update-package, and level
caches. The private internal directory mostly contains `creationtime.dat`.

This corrected the test procedure. It also explains why an exact-looking file
could be present in the private directory without changing the result. Future
notes should always name the complete cache root, not just the relative
`weblevels` directory.

## Evidence levels used in this archive

The notes use three informal evidence levels:

* **Static** means a name, string, cross-reference, or instruction was read
  from the library or IDA database.
* **Local runtime** means a controlled emulator test observed the behavior
  using loopback responders and a diagnostic APK.
* **Live** would mean the unmodified or properly repaired client connected to
  the real service and completed an actual login. No live result is claimed
  yet.

This vocabulary is intentionally repetitive. Reverse-engineering notes become
hard to trust when a local synthetic response is described as if it came from
the production server.

## Update package and script follow-up

The update-package path is now mapped far enough to explain why a synthetic
`FILE StartConnectMessage` line alone does not produce an immediate package
request. `requestUpdatePackage_void` at ARM64 `0x209020` creates or loads
`updatepackages/basepackage.gupd`. `TUpdatePackage_load` at `0x209fa4` parses
the `GRPKG001` header and fields such as `NAME`, `VERSION`, `PLATFORM`,
`SUBPACKAGE`, and `FILE`. A `SUBPACKAGE` entry starts another download during
the load, while a `FILE` entry adds a file to the package's file list.

`TClient_sendRequestUpdatePackage` at `0x1f8e78` sends the package name,
install separator, and one five-byte checksum per listed file. The normal file
request helpers remain separate: `TClient_sendWantImage` uses the packet 23
path, `TClient_sendWantImageUpdateCRC` uses packet 47, and
`TClient_sendPreloadLevel` uses packet 35. The local responder answers these
requests with the native packet 102 file parser. Its multi-packet mode uses
the sequence 68, 84, 102, 69, while the final replay uses one packet 102 per
file. It does not claim to reproduce a complete production package
installation sequence.

The decoded built-in `StartScript_GraalGui` bytecode contains the GUI setup but
does not contain `onPackagesDownloaded`. That explains why adding a minimal
synthetic `StartConnectMessage` package did not by itself hide the native
connecting control. The package path is still worth preserving for future
tests, but it is no longer the leading explanation for the rendered-world
result. The final local run hides the connecting control through packet 190 in
the normal no-swap table.

## Original APK security pass

The first offline security pass is now limited to the original 1.8 APK. The
machine-readable reports are `artifacts/original_apk_security_audit_20260830.json`
and `artifacts/original_security_callsite_review_20260830.json`. The APK audit
does not install the package or contact a host. It records the manifest, DEX
string indicators, packaged ELF metadata, signing metadata, and hashes of the
private input files.

The most important native result is an update boundary. The download-complete
handler at `0x1ec044` can call the executable replacer at `0x196fe0` after all
package downloads complete and a replacement flag is set. The replacer changes
the configured executable mode to `0775`, forks, and calls `execvp` on the
configured path. The reviewed function does not perform a package signature
check itself, so the next step is to trace the package verification and path
provenance before making any repair that enables this branch.

The generic file helper at `0xe6dfc` calls `unlink`. Package uninstall routes
file names through a resource resolver before reaching it. The script-facing
delete path also resolves a policy-controlled filename, checks existence, and
updates the resource object. The policy tables block executable and other
high-risk extensions and restrict folder prefixes, but a complete traversal
review still needs separator, escape, symlink, and archive-entry tests.

The identification path reads `eth0`, stores the six-byte MAC address, and
computes a network ID from an MD5 digest. Other system-ID modes include
hard-disk, OS, and Android ID values. The cookie loader reads
`cache/creationtime.dat` or `files/creationtime.dat` below the native data
folder. These are privacy and account-correlation surfaces rather than proof of
code execution.

The APK also has an effectively exported custom-scheme activity, a DEX-visible
WebView JavaScript bridge, an expired `admin.fabzat.com` certificate resource,
legacy CyaSSL cipher identifiers, and an embedded connector trust bundle whose
earliest recovered certificate expired on 2023-07-29. All four packaged native
libraries report non-executable stacks, GNU RELRO, and `BIND_NOW`. These facts
are documented in `docs/SECURITY.md` with confidence limits so compatibility
failures are not presented as confirmed vulnerabilities.

## Corrected two-connection runtime trace

The first useful local run sent the map and player properties on the same
socket as packet 48. That was wrong because packet 48 is a trigger-action
packet. Static analysis and the successful replay established that packet 178
is the server-warp instruction. The corrected responder sends packet 178 on
connection one, then sends packets 9, 190, and 49 on connection two.

The final trace is:

```text
connection 1: login, packet 178 server-warp, reconnect
connection 2: login, packet 9 minimal player properties
connection 2: packet 190 empty connecting-window completion
connection 2: packet 49 classiciphone.gmap transition
connection 2: client requests basepackage and classiciphone.gmap
connection 2: server returns classiciphone.gmap as packet 102
connection 2: server repeats packet 49 after the map response
connection 2: client requests three level containers through packets 46 and 35
connection 2: server returns each level as packet 102
connection 2: client requests pics1.png through packet 23
connection 2: server returns pics1.png as packet 102
connection 2: client heartbeat packets 24
```

The map response alone left the client with a cached GMAP but did not
immediately re-enter the pending transition. The responder therefore sends a
second packet 49 after returning the map. That event-driven retry causes the
client to request the three level containers and then `pics1.png`.

The x86_64 emulator screenshot after this sequence shows the green tile field,
the player HUD, and the three top-right status icons. The centered blue
`Connecting to classic...` control is absent through the normal packet 190
handler. This proves that the renderer, map cache, level loader, image loader,
and connecting-window transition all run in the bounded local test.

One negative control is worth preserving. A test build routed packet 59
directly to the apparent x86_64 parser block at `0x2096f0`, bypassing the
directly to the apparent x86_64 parser block. That build did not reproduce the
working exchange. It changed the first connection to ordinary packet 23
requests and stopped before the normal second-connection sequence. The direct
jump is therefore rejected as a repair. The working responder uses packet 102
for a complete file response and can also emit the native 68, 84, 102, 69
large-file sequence.

The public game responder accepts `--frame-after-client` and
`--frame-after-map`. The first is useful for event-driven packet experiments.
The second was used here to send packet 49 only after the GMAP response, which
made the successful replay deterministic without a wall-clock delay.
